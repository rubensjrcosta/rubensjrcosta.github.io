 ## Five useful Open Data links

An extensive number of data sources are now available on the Internet providing information freely to anyone in need. The material I am referring to is known as, Open Data. Here I am sharing a list of five Open Data sources, that I hope you will find useful in your data science studies.

You can search thousands of datasets from financial market data to population growth and cryptocurrency prices.

2. [World Health Organization (WHO) Data Collections](https://www.who.int/data/collections)

3. [U.S. Governmentâ€™s Open Data](http://data.gov)
